Title: A faster ARFF file reader and writer
Description: Reads and writes ARFF files, without the Java dependency that RWeka
    enforces. Also much faster. Uses readr as parser backend for
    the data section of the ARFF file. Consistency with RWeka is tested on Github an
    Travis CI with hundreds of ARFF files from OpenML.
